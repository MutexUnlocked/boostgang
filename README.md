# Qboost

The D-Wave quantum computer has been widely studied as a discrete optimization
engine that accepts any problem formulated as quadratic unconstrained binary
optimization (QUBO). In 2008, Google and D-Wave published a paper, [Training a
Binary Classifier with the Quantum Adiabatic
Algorithm](https://arxiv.org/pdf/0811.0416.pdf), which describes how the Qboost
ensemble method makes binary classification amenable to quantum computing: the
problem is formulated as a thresholded linear superposition of a set of weak
classifiers and the D-Wave quantum computer is used to optimize the weights in a
learning process that strives to minimize the training error and number of weak
classifiers

This code demonstrates the use of the D-Wave system to solve a binary
classification problem using the Qboost algorithm.
